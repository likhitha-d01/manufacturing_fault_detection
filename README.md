## Introduction

This is the code repository of my Major project work, **"Manufacturing Fault Detection using Deep Learning"**

The objective of this project is,

*"To develop a universal model for the detection of faults of various manufacturing defect datasets irrespective of the nature of the defects or the products and to develop a streamlined process for preprocessing and training the model for any dataset."*

## The datasets used in this project
 


## Preprocessing

### 1. Dataset structure:

After the datasets are downloaded from their respective sources, they have to be put in a certain folder structure to make it feasible for training. For the same, python programs have been written for each dataset to arrange them in the desired folder structure as shown below:

```python
- dataset
    - train
        - category a
        - category b
        - category c
    - test
        - category a
        - category b
        - category c
```
